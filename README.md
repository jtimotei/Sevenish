# Sevenish
### The result can be found here: jtimotei.com:3000

I will keep updating the game, improving it and adding new features.

This project is devoted to implementing a card game called Septica (in Romanian), which translates to Little Seven. I chose to call it Sevenish.
More information about the game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedma.

I included the node modules so that it would be easier to set up the project on different machines.
